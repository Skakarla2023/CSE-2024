# UNIT-I

#### Algorithm- 
It is a step by step process of solving a given problem.

### Performance analysis of an algorithm:
The efficiency of an algorithm can be decided by measuring the performance of an algorithm.We can measure this by using 2 factors.
They are-

#### Time complexity
Time complexity can be defined as the amount of time taken by the algorithm to execute as function of length of input.

#### Space complexity
Space complexity can be referred as the amount of memory used by the algorithm as a function of length of input.It includes both amount of memory used by the algorithm as well as the input.

- There are different types of notation to represent time complexity of an algorithm. they are called asymptotic notations.
They are-
```
1.Big O notation
2.Theta notation
3.Omega notation
4.small o notation
5.small omega notation
```

|Symbol   | Notation meaning  | example                |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| O(1)    | constant          | sum of 2 numbers       |
| O(n)    | linear            | linear search          |
| O(logn) | logarithmic       | sorting                |
| O(nlogn)| linear arithmetic | divide and conquer     |
| O(n^2)  | quadratic         | addition of 2 matrices |
| O(n^3)  | cubic             |simultaneous linear eqns|
| O(2^n)  | exponential       | towers of hanoii       |

 - A data structure that manitains a linear relationship among its elements is called a LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE.
 - A Data Structure in which elements are not arranged in sequential order is called a NON-LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE.

#### Hashing or Hash Table
Hash table is a data structure used for stoing and retrieving data very quickly.
Insertion of element in hash table is based on the key.

- Types of hash methods
  1. Modulo division method
  2. Mid-square method
  3. digit folding method
  4. Multiplicative method

There are several methods to map keys to indexes 
#### Collision
In data structures collision occurs when two keys map to the same index in a hash table.

- There are several methods called collision resolution techniques to solve the problem of collision

2.Quadratic Probing
3.Seperate chaining
