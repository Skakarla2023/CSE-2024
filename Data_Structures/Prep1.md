- Counting sort
```
Radix sort: It is a non comparative sorting algorithm that sorts the numbersby sorting them digit by digit.
In this the sorting starts from comparing LSB of the number and moves towards the MSB and the final result is the sorted array.

- Dikjstra's algorithm
- If an AVL tree has '2' as the balance factor, what kind of rotation is done to self-balance is left.Because when there are elements in the left subtree of any node the balance factor will be positive otherwise the result will be negative.
