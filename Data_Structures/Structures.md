# Structures

- It can hold variables of different datatypes.

Question 1
What is the purpose of using structures in data structures and algorithms (DSA)?

Structures in DSA are like blueprints for organizing and managing data efficiently. They serve several important purposes:

Modularity: Structures allow you to encapsulate related data into a single entity. For example, a Student structure can contain the student's name, roll number, and marks, making the code cleaner and easier to manage.

Readability: By grouping related data, structures enhance the readability of your code. It becomes easier to understand what each part of your code is doing when related data is organized logically.

Memory Management: Structures help in better memory management. By defining structures, you can efficiently allocate and deallocate memory for related data items.

Code Reusability: Once a structure is defined, it can be used multiple times throughout the program. This promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy.

Data Abstraction: Structures enable data abstraction by allowing you to work with complex data types as single units without worrying about the individual components.

Performance: Structures can improve the performance of algorithms by allowing efficient data access and manipulation. For example, accessing a field in a structure is faster and more efficient than accessing individual variables separately.

In essence, structures provide a way to organize, manage, and manipulate data efficiently, making them an essential tool in data structures and algorithms. They are the building blocks for creating complex data types and implementing various algorithms effectively.
