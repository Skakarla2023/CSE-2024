- Streams can be characterized into byte streams(Input Streams and Output Streams) and character streams(Readers and writers).
- A stream is a sequence of data. In java, Stream is composed of bytes.
- All streams are attached with the console. 
- Java application uses an output stream to write data to a destination; it may be a file or any other.
- Java application uses an input stream to read data from a source, like a file.
- FileInputStream: Used for reading raw byte data from a file. It reads data byte by byte and is suitable for handling binary data.
- FileOutputStream: Used for writing raw byte data to a file. It writes data byte by byte and is also suitable for handling binary data.
