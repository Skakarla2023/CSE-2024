# Introduction

A database is an organized collection of data, stored and accessed electronically.

A database is an electronically stored, systematic collection of data. It can contain any type of data, including words, numbers, images, videos, and files. You can use software called a database management system (DBMS) to store, retrieve, and edit data. In computer systems, the word database can also refer to any DBMS, to the database system, or to an application associated with the database.

Here are some features of DBMS:
1. Structured Data: Databases typically store data in a structured format, often in tables with rows and columns. This makes it easy to organize, search, and retrieve information.   
2. Database Management System (DBMS): Software called a DBMS is used to create, manage, and interact with the database.   
3. Data Types: Databases can store various types of data, including text, numbers, images, and more.   
4. Uses: Databases are used in many ways, such as:

```
Storing business information: Customer data, financial records, product inventories   
Managing website content: User information, product catalogs
Supporting scientific research: Storing and analyzing experimental data   
Powering applications: Many apps rely on databases to store and retrieve information.   
Essentially, a database is a powerful tool for organizing and managing information effectively.
