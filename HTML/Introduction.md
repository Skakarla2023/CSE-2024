# Introduction to HTML

### What is HTML?

- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
- HTML is the standard markup language used for creating web pages.
- HTML defines the structure of the web page.
- It contains a series of tags that define elements used to create the structure of the web page.

Now look at this simple HTML code:-

``` HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>      //this specifies that the document type is HTML
<html>  
<head>              //defines the head part of the code
<title>"Title defines the title of the page"</title>
</head>             //end tag used to end the head part
<body>
<p>"This part contains a paragraph"</p>
</body>
</html>
```
